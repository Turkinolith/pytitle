I like to format the sections of my notes with a bracket of astericks.
Unfortunately, over time it became cumbersome to do this. So, why not apply some of the stuff I've learned and automate it!

This is a very simple command line app built in python that takes an arbitrary string, brackets it, and then copies the result into 
the clipboard for use in whatever text editor you wish.

Requirements:
Python 3.8
pyperclip module for Python

This has been tested to work in Windows, but should be cross platform compatible.

Windows users: the attached link file makes using the app simple, just change the start in field to match the directory the python script resides in.
